# Pixel Perfect Agency

Beautiful, fast, and safe software is what excites us. With our young team, we create web-based software (and everything around it) that helps businesses move forward and makes customers happy. We are innovative, efficient, and critical.

## Our technologies

### Frontend

We use the following technologies to create beautiful and fast web applications:

-   [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
-   [React](https://reactjs.org/)
-   [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
-   [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
-   [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/)

This stack allows us to iterate quickly and deploy fast, interactive, typesafe web applications.

Next.js is the largest and fastest growing React framework. It is built on top of React and provides a lot of features out of the box, we don't want to worry about image optimization, font loading, and other performance optimizations. Next takes a lot of the heavy lifting out of our hands, so we can focus on what really matters: building great software.

We currently use TailwindCSS or SCSS in our projects. SCSS used to be our go-to CSS preprocessor, but with the excellent developer experience that TailwindCSS provides, we are moving away from SCSS in projects where this makes sense.

### Backend

Our backend framework of choice is Laravel. We use it to create robust REST APIs. The Laravel framework is very mature and has a large community.

## Open source

We are big fans of open source software. We believe that open source software is the future of software development. We are currently working on a few open source projects, which you can find on our [GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/pixel-perfect-agency/repositories) when they are released.

### [next-foundation](https://github.com/pixel-perfect-agency/next-foundation)

We created a Next.js starter template that we use for all our new projects.

Next.js it is a great framework for building React applications. It is very easy to get started with and has a lot of great features. However, it's not very opinionated about how a project should be structured. This is fine for a small project built in free time but can become a problem when working on a large project with a team of developers. This is where this project comes in.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:pixel-perfect-agency/next-foundation.git
```

### [eslint-config-pixel](https://github.com/pixel-perfect-agency/eslint-config-pixel)

We created our own [ESLint](https://eslint.org) config (also includes [prettier](https://prettier.io/) config) to make sure we write consistent code. We use it in all our projects and we are happy to share it with the world.

```bash
npm install --save-dev eslint-config-pixel
```

### [stylelint-config-pixel](https://github.com/pixel-perfect-agency/stylelint-config-pixel)

We use [stylelint](https://stylelint.io) to make sure we write consistent SCSS code. We use it in all frontend and dashboard projects.

```bash
npm install --save-dev stylelint-config-pixel
```
